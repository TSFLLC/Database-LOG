 --Step 1
Run the below command to get info about all deleted transactions.
   USE DBName
   GO
     
 SELECT 
    [Transaction ID],
    Operation,
    Context,
    AllocUnitName
    FROM 
    fn_dblog(NULL, NULL) 
   WHERE 
    Operation = 'LOP_DELETE_ROWS'

	--Step 2
	--We found the transaction ID from the above command which we will use in the below command to get the transaction SID of the user who has deleted the data.
	
	USE DBName
        GO
SELECT
    Operation,
    [Transaction ID],
    [Begin Time],
    [Transaction Name],
    [Transaction SID]
FROM
    fn_dblog(NULL, NULL)
WHERE
    [Transaction ID] = '0000:000003d6'   --Copy and paste here the Traansaction ID from the above command
AND
    [Operation] = 'LOP_BEGIN_XACT'    ---Always use this  'LOP_BEGIN_XACT' 


	--Step 3
	--Now we will figure out who ran the DELETE command. We will copy the hexadecimal value from the transaction SID column
  for the DELETE transaction and then pass that value into the SUSER_SNAME () function.
	
  USE MASTER
    GO   
    SELECT SUSER_SNAME(0x01050000000000051500000039BCB715A55DCF5BE3190CD9E9030000)
